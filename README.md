# E-Commerce App

## Project Description

- A mobile e-commerce application designed to provide an easy and convenient shopping
experience for users.

- Offers two user profiles: normal users and administrators, each with its own set of
features and capabilities

## Features

#### For Normal Users

on various criteria such as category, price, and product name.

- Choose between two payment options: cash on delivery or online payment via Stripe, a
well-known and secure payment platform.
- Conveniently place orders and monitor their status through the app.


#### For Administrators Dashboard Features:
- A powerful and intuitive dashboard exclusively for administrators, allowing them to
manage the product catalog and monitor orders.
- Add new categories, create new products, edit existing products and product images,
and manage product availability.
- Monitor all orders and manage order processing, from receiving the order to delivering
the product.
- Visualize the number of in-stock and out-of-stock products using a pie chart, providing a
quick overview of their inventory and helping to make informed decisions.
