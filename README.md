#### For Administrators Dashboard Features:
- A powerful and intuitive dashboard exclusively for administrators, allowing them to
manage the product catalog and monitor orders.
- Add new categories, create new products, edit existing products and product images,
and manage product availability.
- Monitor all orders and manage order processing, from receiving the order to delivering
the product.
